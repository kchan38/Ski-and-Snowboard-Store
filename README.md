# Ski and Snowboard Store
<br>

## Project Description
<br>

**What will this application do?**

This application will be an online store that sells ski and snowboard gear. It will allow users to look through
different items to buy, choosing different sizes and colours, and adding it to their shopping cart to purchase. The
types of items this online store will sell ranges from clothing, to skis and snowboards, to accessories needed while 
on the mountain (ie. helmets, gloves, goggles).

**Who will use it?**

Customers who are looking to buy ski and snowboard gear.

**Why is this project interesting to me?**

I grew up skiing at a young age with my family, and loved it all these years. The soft snow, fresh air, and excitement
I get from being on the mountain is unmatched. To try something new, I recently learned to snowboard and even bought 
new snowboarding gear. I love the ease and efficiency of online shopping, so that's why I combined both these things
to build an online store.
